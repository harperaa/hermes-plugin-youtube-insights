# YouTube Gap Finder

Find what everyone else is missing — then build video concepts around it.

## When to Use This Skill

- User says "find gaps", "what's missing", "differentiators", "unique angle"
- User wants video concepts that won't repeat what's already out there
- User asks for "net new information gain"
- User runs `/youtube-gap-finder` with no arguments (default workspace-sweep mode)
- A kanban task from the Trends page ✨ button names a **specific source video** (single-source mode)

## Modes

This skill has three modes. **Pick one based on the caller's inputs and do not mix them.**

### Mode A — Single-Source Video (NEW, use when a specific video is named)

Use this mode when the invocation provides a single source video — typically a kanban task created by the YouTube Trends page ✨ Generate button. Signals that you are in this mode:

- The task brief or user message names one specific video (title + videoId + URL)
- The task brief provides an explicit transcript path, video workspace directory, and output directory
- The goal is "similar but unique" content relative to that one source, not a sweep

In this mode:

- You are producing content that is **intentionally similar in topic/angle** to the named source video, but with **net new information gain** (not a rehash).
- Do NOT call the `yt_trending` tool for a ranking sweep. Do NOT scan the recommended/ folder for prior runs. Do NOT look at the last completed routine's outputs — you are not picking up where a routine left off.
- Output is **3 concept files in ONE topic folder**, not 9 across 3 topics. Use the output directory the caller provides verbatim (typically `youtube/{today}/recommended/{source-title-slug}/`). Do not invent alternate paths.

### Mode B — Workspace Sweep (default when invoked with no arguments)

The legacy default: analyze the top-performing tracked videos across the workspace, find gaps across them, and produce 3 topic folders × 3 formats = 9 concept files. Use when:

- `/youtube-gap-finder` is run with no arguments
- The goal is to discover new directions across the whole tracked set, not respond to one video

### Mode C — Topic + URLs (ad-hoc)

User provides a topic and/or specific video URLs not yet in the workspace. Transcripts must come through the plugin's own pipeline: track the channel (`yt_add_channel`) and run `yt_fetch_videos` to pull its recent videos + transcripts, then run the same Phase 2-5 workflow. If a URL's video is outside the fetch lookback window or its channel shouldn't be tracked, say so and ask the user how to proceed — there is no ad-hoc transcript fetcher; do not invent one.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Gather Sources

**Mode A (single source):**

1. **Read the source video's `analysis.md`** from the video workspace directory provided by the caller. The task's Step 0 covers this: if `analysis.md` is missing, run the `youtube-insights:youtube-video-analyst` skill yourself against the video's transcript first (it is attached to the task for exactly this case). If no transcript exists on disk either, block the task (`kanban_block` with kind `needs_input`) explaining the transcript is missing — do NOT substitute a different video.
2. Read ONLY the **Video Summary** and **Top 20 Insights** sections (≈ first 80 lines). Skip the viral-mechanics sections.
3. Optionally (for corroborating context only): call the `yt_trending` tool (top 10 by VPH) and skim the **Video Summaries** of any videos in the same theme cluster as the source. Use them to verify that a candidate "gap" is truly a gap vs. already covered elsewhere. Do NOT treat these corroborating videos as co-equal sources — the source of record is the one named video.
4. **Report what you found** to the user, e.g.:
   ```
   Source: "This Tool Made My Coding Agent Powerful" (Brian Casel) — analysis.md loaded (82 lines).
   Corroborating context: 4 tracked videos in "coding tools" cluster.
   ```

**Mode B (workspace sweep):**

1. **Get the top 10 VPH videos** by calling the `yt_trending` tool. Each
   entry includes the video's workspace directory (under the reported
   `workspaceRoot`); its `analysis.md` lives there.
2. **For each video**, read ONLY the **Video Summary** and **Top 20 Insights** sections from its `analysis.md` file (≈ first 80 lines). Do NOT read the viral mechanics sections (Section 1-11). These are too large and not needed for gap analysis.
3. **Skip videos without `analysis.md`** — they don't have enough processed data for gap analysis.
4. **Report what you found** to the user:
   ```
   Found 7/10 videos with analysis:
   1. [3,551 VPH] Codex 5.3 vs Opus 4.6 (Nate B Jones) ✓
   2. [3,243 VPH] Multi-Agent Team with OpenClaw (Brian Casel) ✓
   ...
   Skipped 3 (no analysis.md)
   ```

**Mode C (topic + URLs):** get transcripts via the plugin pipeline (`yt_add_channel` + `yt_fetch_videos` — see the Mode C description above), then produce stub analysis (Video Summary + Top 20 Insights) for each video. Proceed as in Mode B.

### Phase 1.5: Query the Insight Knowledge Base

Before mapping individual video insights, query the aggregated insight database to understand the landscape:

1. **Call the `yt_search_insights` tool** with broad queries for each major theme cluster you see in the video titles (e.g. "AI agents", "coding tools", "content creation", "automation"):
   - Note which topics have HIGH source counts (5+ sources = saturated, everyone covered it)
   - Note which topics have LOW source counts (1-2 sources = underserved, potential gap)
   - Note which categories have the most/fewest insights

2. **Identify insight density patterns:**
   - **Saturated**: 10+ insights on the same theme → skip unless you have a genuinely contrarian angle
   - **Emerging**: 3-5 insights with recent timestamps → trending, good for hot takes
   - **Underserved**: 1-2 insights → depth gap, good for original content
   - **Missing**: search returns nothing → insight gap, highest value

3. **Record the landscape summary** — you'll use this in Phase 3 to validate whether a "gap" is truly a gap or just something the top 10 videos missed but others covered.

### Phase 2: Map the Insight Landscape (working context — do not save to file)

For each video, extract from its **Video Summary + Top 20 Insights** only:

- List every distinct insight, claim, data point, entity, tactic, and story
- Tag each insight by theme cluster (e.g., "agent architecture", "job market", "cost optimization")
- Flag insights that could combine with insights from OTHER videos to produce a synthesized idea neither video delivered alone

### Phase 3: Find the Gaps (working context — do not save to file)

Cross-reference the video analysis insights (Phase 2) with the knowledge base landscape (Phase 1.5). For each potential gap, call `yt_search_insights` to verify it's truly a gap — not just missing from the top 10 videos but already covered in the broader database.

Compare all insight inventories across videos and identify:

#### 1. Insight Gaps (what nobody said)
- Themes, claims, or angles that ZERO videos covered
- Questions a viewer would still have after watching all of them
- Adjacent topics that connect but nobody bridged

#### 2. Synthesis Gaps (insights that combine but nobody connected)
- Insight A from Video 1 + Insight B from Video 3 = new idea C that neither delivered
- Cross-video patterns that are visible in aggregate but invisible in isolation
- **This is the highest-value gap type** — it produces genuinely novel content from existing material

#### 3. Depth Gaps (what everyone mentioned but nobody explained)
- Points name-dropped but not unpacked
- Claims made without evidence or examples
- Steps glossed over in "how-to" content

#### 4. Perspective Gaps (what viewpoint is missing)
- Is everyone giving the same type of advice?
- Is there a contrarian take with merit?
- Is there a practitioner's view vs. everyone being commentators?
- Is there an audience segment being ignored?

#### 5. Freshness Gaps (what's outdated or evolving)
- Are videos citing old data or deprecated tools?
- Is there a breaking development nobody has covered yet?

#### 6. Storytelling Gaps (what experience is missing)
- Are all videos lecture-style with no real stories?
- Could a personal experience, case study, or live demo differentiate?

### Phase 4: Build Video Concepts

**Mode A (single source):** produce **1 topic** derived from the named source video — a similar-but-unique angle — in **3 format variants**. Total: 3 concept files in the caller-provided output directory.

**Mode B / C:** produce **3 topics**, each exploiting a different cluster of gaps, × **3 format variants** per topic. Total: 9 concept files.

Each concept exploits a different cluster of gaps to produce a video with genuine net new information gain — content that passes YouTube's Gist Filter because it delivers insights no existing video contains.

For each concept, generate **3 separate concept files** — 3 different formats that approach the same topic from different angles:

1. **`concepts.md`** — The standard deep-dive format (as described below). Balanced, thorough, synthesized from multiple sources. This is the primary video script.

2. **`concepts-hot-take.md`** — A hot take format. Same topic, but:
   - Lead with the most provocative or surprising insight
   - Shorter (8-10 min target vs 12-16 min)
   - Strong opinion, bold predictions, name names
   - "Here's what nobody is telling you about X" energy
   - Pick the single most contrarian data point and build the video around it
   - Skip nuance in favor of impact — the goal is to spark debate

3. **`concepts-contrarian.md`** — A contrarian view format. Same topic, but:
   - Deliberately argue AGAINST the consensus position across all source videos
   - "Everyone says X, but here's why they're wrong" structure
   - Find the strongest evidence that contradicts the mainstream narrative
   - Steel-man the contrarian position with real data, not just hot air
   - Address and dismantle the strongest arguments for the consensus view
   - End with a reframe that synthesizes both sides into a higher-order insight

All 3 formats use the same concept structure below, but with different thesis angles, insight selection, and tone.

For each concept file, use the following structure:

**Part 1: Video Summary (~1000 words)**

Write the summary of the NEW video that would be created. This should read like the "Video Summary" section of an analysis.md file — a flowing narrative describing:
- The central thesis and why it matters
- The key arguments and evidence
- The progression of ideas
- What the viewer learns that they cannot learn from any existing video
- How insights from multiple source videos are synthesized into something new

**Part 2: Key Insights (20+ numbered insights)**

Write at least 20 insights for this new video, in the exact same format as the source analysis.md insight format:

```
1. **Bold claim statement.** Supporting explanation with specific data points, entity names, and evidence. Connect to the broader thesis.

2. **Another bold claim.** Explanation with specifics...
```

Each insight should be one of:
- A **synthesis insight** — combining insights from 2+ source videos into a new idea neither delivered
- A **depth insight** — unpacking something source videos mentioned but never explained
- A **original insight** — filling a gap no source video touched at all
- A **contrarian insight** — challenging a consensus claim across source videos with evidence

Tag each insight with its source type in parentheses at the end: (synthesis: V1+V3), (depth: V5), (original), (contrarian: V2).

Every concept file needs at least 20 insights — this is the minimum bar for a concept worth producing. If you're running low on output capacity, prioritize completing 20 insights per file over adding extra analysis files. The 20-insight threshold matters because the downstream `youtube-content-creator` skill maps insights to beats; fewer than 20 doesn't give enough material for a full video script.

No formatting instructions, no hook templates, no beat maps, no viral mechanics. Just the concept summary and insights. The `youtube-content-creator` skill handles formatting and production.

### Phase 5: Save Output

Save concept files only. Do not save gap analysis reports, phase summaries, or intermediate work as separate files. The phases 1-3 analysis is working context that you report to the user conversationally, not files to save.

**Mode A (single source) — exactly 3 files in 1 folder:**

Use the output directory the caller provided (do not invent one). Typically:

```
youtube/{today}/recommended/{source-title-slug}/
  concepts.md               # Standard deep-dive
  concepts-hot-take.md      # Hot take format
  concepts-contrarian.md    # Contrarian view format
```

The `{source-title-slug}` comes from the source video's title — the caller will usually supply the exact path. If a folder already exists at that path from a prior run, overwrite the 3 concept files in place; do NOT create a sibling folder with a suffix and do NOT skip because "content already exists." Single-source runs are idempotent and authoritative for their source video.

**Mode B / C — exactly 9 files in 3 folders:**

```
youtube/{today}/recommended/
  {title-slug-1}/
    concepts.md               # Standard deep-dive
    concepts-hot-take.md       # Hot take format
    concepts-contrarian.md     # Contrarian view format
  {title-slug-2}/
    concepts.md
    concepts-hot-take.md
    concepts-contrarian.md
  {title-slug-3}/
    concepts.md
    concepts-hot-take.md
    concepts-contrarian.md
```

**Title slugs**: lowercase, hyphens for spaces, strip non-alphanumeric except hyphens, max 80 chars. Derived from the proposed video title (Mode B/C) or the source video title (Mode A).

The `youtube-content-creator` skill will then produce a `script-outline.md` for each concept file.

## Algorithm Context

Why gap-finding matters:

- **Gist Filter** — YouTube's pre-ranking filter rejects videos too similar to existing content. Gaps = information gain = passing the filter.
- **Semantic IDs** — The algorithm maps spoken words to knowledge graph nodes. Concepts should use proper entity names, not slang.
- **GARM Brand Safety** — Original, human-produced content with clear expertise is favored over AI-generated slop.

## Design Principles

- **Insights are everything** — the concept exists to deliver insights no other video delivers. Every insight should be concrete, specific, and defensible.
- **Synthesis is king** — the highest-value concepts weave together insights from multiple source videos into ideas that are invisible in isolation but obvious in aggregate.
- **Specificity over abstraction** — use entity names, numbers, company names, study citations. Vague insights have zero information gain.
- **Respect the mode** — Mode A produces 1 topic × 3 formats; Mode B/C produces 3 topics × 3 formats. Never mix.
- **Similar-but-unique in Mode A** — the concept is intentionally adjacent to the source video's topic. The differentiation is the gaps/synthesis/contrarian angle, not the topic area.
- **Do not meander** — if invoked via a task brief that names a specific video and output directory, go straight to that directory and produce the 3 concept files. Do not hunt for prior outputs, do not reconcile with other routines, do not defer work because "a refresh is in progress."
